 * This struct is a simple stack implementation that stores Zobrist keys to
 * check for two-fold repetition.
 * Each time before a move is made, the board position is pushed onto the stack.
 * When the move is unmade or we return back up the search tree, the positions
 * are popped off the stack one by one.
 * The find() function loops through to look for a two-fold repetition. We must
 * only find the first repeat from the top of the stack since we have the
 * condition that the branch terminates immediately returning 0 if two-fold
 * repetition occurs in that branch.
